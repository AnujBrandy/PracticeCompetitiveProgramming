Find Union Disjoint Set

This is the algorithm that is substantial in the implentation of the kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm. 

The idea behind the algorithm is that we have disjoint sets with us. And we have items in those sets. We can perform union between any two elements
meaning that the two sets that have those items will now point to a single set. Check the code and the image to have a better understanding of 
how union works.

Findset(i) .. Finds the representative of the set that has the item i.

IsSameSet(i,j) checks whether two items i and j has the same representative element.

initSet(_size) initially creates _size disjoint sets with each element as the parent of itself.

SizeOfSet(i) returns the number of items that is present in the set that has the item i.

NumberOfSets() returns the total nunmber of disjoint sets at any time.

Please refer to the image for better understanding.
